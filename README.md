# ðŸ˜ˆ Course-Roast ðŸ”¥

## Overview

Course Roast is a a one stop dashboard to post and view anonymous feedback for all cs classes. Built on the idea of creating more granular data like number of hours spent on a course or how creative a course is, course roast aims to move away from making a class about a professor (like RMP) and instead focus on the _class_ itself
